Here is a list of TODO's. If you are interested in tackling any of them, let
me know. I would be happy to clarify anything since some of the elements in the
list are not very descriptive. Also, it's always good to check to make sure
someone else is not already working on it.

SHORT RUN TODO:

- Makefile Editor popup menu:
  Add a popup menu to the Makefile Editor that contains the following items;
  Add new element, Remove element, Edit properties and Refresh. The first three
  will be separated from the last by a separator. This should be loaded from a
  ui file and loaded with a UI manager.

LONG RUN TODO:

- Makefile Editor Docs:
  These really need done & possibly linked to by the Makefile Editor itself.

- Project Template Docs:
  This isn't really that urgent, but they would be nice since the system is
  easily expandable.

- Debugger plugin (in main tabs)
  This is a very necessary feature. I think it will end up being the plugin that
  will cause the jump to 0.7 since it will take a lot of work.

- TODO manager plugin (_I_ need this)
  Yes, this would be very nice. Maybe a calendar interface in the bottom
  OutputManager pane?

- Make all panels detachable
  This will be useful in the future. It would be nice if everything can detach
  itself and be self contained. That way people can move everything. If we do
  this, both dimensions of the OutputManager and SideBar will need to be
  tracked in case they are attached at a different side.

- Extend GtkSourceView (add Scintilla features):
  This has been requested multiple times since GtkSourceView is somewhat
  limited. I still stand strong in the face that GtkSourceView is the best
  choice for a Gtk+ IDE. It just needs a little work. Maybe some of this can be
  pushed back into the main codebase? In any case, we will need to have this
  derived as a custom widget for now.
  + Function folding (For {}, () and <>)
  + Bookmarks

- Class/Symbol browser:
  This is also requested a lot. Maybe we can use ctags? This will go in the
  SideBar as a new tab. I think something needs done with the sidebar to make
  it more manageable, but I don't want to add dual layers of GtkNotebooks.

- Extend project info dialog:
  The format needs to stay the same because the GtkTreeView is working. It is
  very simple. It does need to do more though.

- Glade-3 plugin:
  This is so a wish list item. Glade-3 is not near ready, so it's not much of a
  concern yet, but once it is ready, this plugin will help make OpenLDev a
  killer app for C/C++ developers using Gtk+. Besides, all of the cool kids are
  doing it. Or maybe that's just all of the bloated IDE's (hehe).

- Tab manager support for non-FileTab objects:
  This is already somewhat done. It just needs tested by a plugin. The
  debugger plugin will make sure this is working, but it'd be nice to know that
  it is ready before diving into that problem.

- More useful status bar:
  Let's face it. The current status bar sucks. It needs to be seriously
  retooled to have multiple panes. Also, can we find a use for that progress
  bar in it, because I am about to switch it back from a GnomeAppBar.

- Profile memory usage in OpenLDev:
  This could be a research project for someone I guess. It would be really nice
  if someone could provide good leak reports. I worked a bit with Valgrind, but
  haven't had the time to do extensive research into this.
